## About Find your Pet App
Information about owners and their pets are retrieved with a web service and stored in a database. Pets can be missing or not, but their location is always available.
The data from the database is displayed as Live Data in lists, a collapsible toolbar and a Google Map fragment. When a marker on the map is clicked, a toast with the owners or pets name appears.
